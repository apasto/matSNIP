# matSNIP

[![Project Status: Inactive – The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)

⚠️ The functions that I am providing here have been both an excercise and a useful tool, for me. Howerver, most of the map-related functionalities are better implemented in GMT modules and conveniently wrapped in the [GMTMex GMT API for MATLAB](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmtmex). **Use those, do not bother with these!** Among other considerations, I am not mantaining this repository. Also, I will likely move some of the functions (such as RoundToStep and TileCheckerboard) to a separate repository. ⚠️

matSNIP: short, simple, .m functions that I am using across repositories and projects (hence *common*).
Most of the times these come from refactoring of larger scripts (hence *snippets*).

Since they reflect the original scope for which they were written for, they mostly manage data on rectangularly sampled geographical grids, stored in arrays as meshgrids or with accompanying grid-vectors.
Whenever there is a reference to the term "map array", this is what is meant.

Nothing is particularly breathtaking, but they have already proved useful, and are generic enough that keeping them in a private repository would have been pointless.

## Prerequisites

Dependencies were listed by calling `matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts` on the function files, in MATLAB 2018b.

* Toolboxes: **FwdRepro** and **InvRepro** use [`mfwtran`](https://mathworks.com/help/map/ref/mfwdtran.html) and [`minvtran`](https://mathworks.com/help/map/ref/minvtran.html), which are provided in the MATLAB Mapping Toolbox.

* OCTAVE compatibility: **ell2sph**, **sph2ell**, **FwdRepro**, **InvRepro** perform calls to functions which have not been implemented yet (in version 1.2.1, as reported [here](https://wiki.octave.org/Mapping_package#Missing_functions)). This list may not be exhaustive.

## Installing

Add the repository folder (the one that this README is in) to your MATLAB® path.
The contents of './+SNIP' will be then available as a 'package directory'.

`SNIP.` must be prefixed to the called function.

Example:

```matlab
SNIP.function_name()
```

## List of scripts/functions

The contents of this list and of `SNIP.DispContents` are automatically updated after every commit is pushed, using Travis CI.
